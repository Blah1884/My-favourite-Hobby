  I love Cricket because it's a game of competition and teamwork blending into each other. Cricket is a game that is very famous all around the world. I don't know how but something connects me to cricket very tightly. Cricket requires 11 people in each team with 1 captain and 1 vice captain. You need to hit the ball with your bat and you get runs when you do so. It's a super interesting game. This is the reason why I love cricket.
